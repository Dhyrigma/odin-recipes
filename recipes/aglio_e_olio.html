    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>No two aglio e olio recipes are alike, but this one is pretty true to the classic method. 
        The key is slowly toasting the garlic slices to a perfect golden brown in the olive oil. 
        If it's too light, you don't get the full flavor and if it's too dark it gets bitter.</p>

    <h2>Our Recipe</h2>
    <p>Here is our alternative recipe!</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>

        <li>400g of spaghetti</li>

        <li>1 teaspoon of red pepper flakes (adjust to taste)</li>
        <li>Salt to taste</li>
        <li>Fresh parsley, chopped (for garnish)</li>
